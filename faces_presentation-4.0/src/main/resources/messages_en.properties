about_01 = A database of facial expressions in younger, middle-aged, and older women and men

about_02 = FACES is a set of images of naturalistic faces of 171 younger (n = 58), middle-aged (n = 56), and older (n = 57) women and men displaying each of six facial expressions: neutrality, sadness, disgust, fear, anger, and happiness.

about_03 = The database comprises two sets of pictures per person and per facial expression, resulting in a total of 2,052 images. It was developed between 2005 and 2007 by Ulman Lindenberger, Natalie Ebner, and Michaela Riediger at the Center for Lifespan Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany.

agreement_04 = 3. All requests for access to the FACES database must be forwarded to the FACES Technical Agent.

agreement_05 = 4. The FACES database must not be distributed, published, copied, or further disseminated in any way or form whatsoever, whether for profit or not.

Research-related publication and display of these photographs are permitted for the purpose of illustrating research methodology. These photographs must not be published or displayed for any other purpose. All other rules fully apply to this subset of pictures as well.

agreement_09 = 8. All documents and papers that report on research that uses the FACES database are requested to acknowledge the use of the FACES database by citing the reference below. The FACES Technical Agent will communicate updates to this reference.

After the profile is finished, metadata values can be added to each picture within the collection, either one by one, or within batch operations. \r\nCollections can be kept private, so that they are only visible by the creator, but they also can be published on the web to make them visible and reusable by other researchers around the world.\r\n\r\nFurther on, users can also create albums on IMEGI. Within these albums, they can collect images with different metadata profiles, which means images from different collections. Similar to collections, albums can alse be kept private or can be published.
