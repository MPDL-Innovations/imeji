<!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Home, About, Registration, Help) -->FACES
is a database of facial expressions in
adults of different ages that is freely available for usage
in scientific research. It contains 2,052 pictures of naturalistic
facial
expressions of 171 younger, middle-aged and older
adults. For each person, two sets of images are available, depicting
six different emotions.
<br />To protect the personal rights of the people involved, the
pictures contained in FACES are only available to researchers on a
case-by-case
basis (e.g. person-by-person and study-by-study). Unregistered users
can view 72 example pictures of
six different people to gain insight into the FACES application and
some of its functions.
The main difference is that not logged-in users will not be
able to see any function regarding <a href="#6._Album">albums</a>.
<br />
Full access to this online service is only possible after registration
and log-in. To apply for an account, please complete the <a href="https://zim02.gwdg.de/repos/faces/trunk/faces/faces_static/doc/agreement.pdf" target="_blank">application form</a>.<br />
<br /><b>News</b><br />
As FACES will be extended over time by the addition of further data and
functions, there is a news
section on the FACES homepage where all information concerning its
development will be seen. <br /> <a href="#Faces_Help">top

</a><br /><br /><h2><a name="3._Browsing"></a>3.
Browsing</h2>
<!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Browse) -->All
pictures contained in FACES are listed on the pictures page. The
user can browse through
them, change the number of hits per page and the sorting order based on
the
five available attributes <i>Age, Emotion, Gender, Person-ID </i>and<i>
Picture Set</i>. Changes in the display will be saved till the end
of the session for each
user.
<br />It is possible to add a picture to a private album while
browsing. For details see <a href="#6.3_Add_pictures_to_an_Album">add
pictures to an album</a>.
<br /><br /><h3><a name="3.1_Sorting"></a>3.1
Sorting</h3>Per default, following multiple sorting will be used:
<br /><i>Emotion</i> (will be sorted alphabetically: <i>Anger,
Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutrality and Sadness</i>), <i>Person-ID,
Picture Set</i>.
<br />To change the sorting, the user can select the desirable
sorting
criteria in the drip down bixes and klick on "Sort" to use the new
selected multiple sorting. Further on, ascending and descending can be
changed for each sorting criteria.
<br /> <a href="#Faces_Help">top
</a><br /><br /><h2><a name="4._Search"></a>4.
Search</h2>
<!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Search, Search Results, All pictures of one person)-->It
is possible to search within the whole faces collection (default
setting) or within a specific published<a href="#6._Album">
album</a>.
<br />All searches are carried out on the basis of special
attributes used to
describe each picture
(e.g. <i>Emotion</i>, <i>Age</i>).
Please note that when several search components are
selected, the following rule applies: search criteria within the same
attribute will be
combined using the Boolean operator "OR" (e.g., <i>Emotion</i>
= <i>Anger</i> OR <i>Emotion</i> = <i>Happiness</i>),
while different types of attributes will be connected by the Boolean
operator "AND" (e.g., <i>Age</i>
= <i>Young</i> AND <i>Emotion</i>
= <i>Happiness</i>).<br />
Adding a picture from the search results to a private album is
possible. For details see <a href="#6.3_Add_pictures_to_an_Album">add
pictures to an album</a>.
<br /><br /><b>Person-ID
</b><br />It is possible to search for a specific person
via their
ID. Only triple-digit numbers can be
extended in this field. Please note that only IDs in the range 004-182
exist,
but that not all numbers within this range are assigned to a person
(there are
only 171 people in the collection).
<br /><b><br />Picture
Set
</b><br />Each emotion was photographed twice of each
person.
Therefore, there are two <i>Picture Sets</i> labelled <i>a
</i>and <i>b.</i>
These are not intended as a quality criterion but rather for comparison
purposes. Pictures were randomly assigned to set <i>a </i>or
<i>b.</i>
<br /> <a href="#Faces_Help">top
</a><br /><br /><h2><a name="5._Detailed_View"></a>5.
Detailed
View </h2>
<!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Detailed View, Picture for Comparison) -->The
<i>View</i>
button below each picture has the same effect as clicking on the
picture itself. It provides detailed information about the picture and
an
enlarged version in optimal resolution for use on the internet
(labelled <i>Web Resolution).</i>
<br />Moreover, it is possible to view the technical metadata of
the picture
in its
original resolution and all pictures of the selected person.
<br /><br />When viewing the details of a picture, it is
also possible to go to the
details for the previous
/ next picture. This navigation is based on the last picture list,
which the user
started viewing the first picture&rsquo;s details from.
<br />Adding a picture from the detailed view to a private album
is possible. For
details see <a href="#6.3_Add_pictures_to_an_Album">add
pictures to an album</a>.
<br /><br /><b>Tab <i>Attributes</i></b><br />All
attributes of the selected picture are stored
in this
tab.
<br /><br /><b>Tab <i>Toggle between
Sets</i></b><br />For each person every emotion was
photographed
twice. The
difference
between these two sets of pictures is labelled using the attribute <i>Picture
Set</i>
with values <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. By
clicking on the <i>Toggle between Sets</i> tab the
same picture from the other picture set will be displayed for a
detailed comparison. <br />
This tab is only available in the detailed view during browsing. When
viewing a
picture of an album, this function is not available.<br /> <a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><br />
<br /><h2><a name="6._Album"></a>6. Album</h2>
<!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Resolve Published Albums by URL) -->An
album is a set
of selected pictures within the FACES collection created by a user. The
aim of
an album is to give researchers the opportunity to create their own
selection
of pictures which can be used as a basis for further studies. Albums
can be
used as private selections (only visible to the user who created the
album) or
can be published to reference them within a publication (visible to all
logged-in
FACES users). <br />
A
user has to be logged-in to the system to use the album functions.<br />
<br /><h3><a name="6.1_Album_States"></a>6.1
Album States</h3>
<b>Private</b><br />
<!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Create Album, Edit Album, Confirm Delete) -->First
an album has to be
created. This means the user has to enter a name for their album with
their
name as the author. Optionally, they may add further authors and a
description
about the album's content. Each author has to be affiliated to at least
one organization, so that
a
minimum background about the person is available. <br />Furthermore, the
user can
set the new album immediately as <i><a href="#6.3_Add_pictures_to_an_Album">Active Album</a></i>.
This selection will be
valid until the user sets another of their private albums as active one
or until they close the session.<br />
After its creation, the album is in the state "private". That means
that it is only visible to the creator (the so called <i>Owner</i>),
who can
add and remove as many pictures as they like (see <a href="#6.3_Add_pictures_to_an_Album">add pictures to an
album</a>). Further on, the owner has
the option to edit the album's metadata or to delete the whole album
when it is
of no more use. <br />
<br /><b>Published</b><br />
<!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Confirm Publish) -->Is
the owner of an album
satisfied with its content they can publish it to make the metadata and
the
pictures of the album visible for all FACES users (logged-in users).
During
publishing, the album will automatically be persistently identified.
The album
is now in the state "published" meaning it can not be edited or
changed any more and is fully visible within FACES. Deletion of the
album is no
longer possible, because it could already be cited by someone. <br />
A not logged-in user who follows a link to a published album within
FACES will
only see the metadata of the album but not the pictures. These are only
visible
after being logged-in. <br />
<br /><b>Withdrawn</b><br />
<!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Confirm Withdrawn) -->The
way of deleting an already published album is to
withdraw it. For this command a comment specifying the reason of the
withdrawal has
to be entered. The album is now in the state "withdrawn". It is not
visible any more in the FACES overview of the published albums but
still retrievable for users who know the exact URL of the album. That still
works
because the persistent URL will stay valid. (It could happen that the
album was
cited by someone. The concept of the persistent URL is that the URL
will work
for ever. But the withdrawal comment demonstrates that the creator of
the album
is not content with the album any more.) Further on, the withdrawn
album
is still
visible in
the album list of the owner.<br /><a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><br />
<br /><h3><a name="6.2_Album_Lists"></a>6.2
Album
Lists</h3>
<!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: My Albums, List View private Album, List View withdrawn Album, Published Albums, List view Published albums) -->There
are two lists of
albums in FACES. <br />
<br /><b>My Albums</b><br />
Firstly, there is the <i>My Albums</i> list, which
contains all albums created by the individual
user (identified via the user account) independently of their state
(private,
published or withdrawn). This individual list can be sorted by the
following
criteria: album name, number of pictures, description, date last
modified and
state.&nbsp;<br />
It is possible to delete several private albums in the list in one
step. To do
this, the checkbox in front of the album name has to be selected and
the user
has to click on <i>Delete</i>.<br />
<br /><b>Published
Albums</b><br />
Secondly, there is the <i>Published Albums</i>
list, which contains all albums published by FACES&nbsp;users. This list is therefore the same for all logged-in users.<br />
This list can also be sorted by the following criteria: album name,
number of pictures,
description, date published, author and affiliation of the author.
Furthermore,
the open text
search searches within the album names,&nbsp;authors, affiliations and descriptions.<br />
<br />Similar to browsing, changes in the number of hits per page
or the
sorting
order of an album list will be saved till the end of the
session for each user.<br />
The user has to click on the name of the album to view the pictures in
an album
and their detailed metadata.<br style="" /> <a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><br />
<br /><h3><a name="6.3_Add_pictures_to_an_Album"></a>6.3
Add pictures to an Album</h3>
Adding pictures to a
private album (this is no longer possible for published or withdrawn
albums) is
a function that is offered nearly always when viewing pictures (such
as
browse, search results, detailed view of a picture). To do this, an
album for
adding the pictures to has to be selected in the drop down menu "Active Album".&nbsp;It
includes a list of all private albums so that the user can easily
switch
between them. However, it is only possible to select one album at a
time. <br />
When viewing a picture within an album, the picture can also be added
to another
album. Here the drop down menu is not on top of the page, but below the
attributes of the picture. In this way the user can easily distinguish
between browsing
the
FACES collection and viewing the pictures in an album.<br />
<br />Below each picture within FACES an <i>Add</i>
button is
displayed, which
is linked to the <i>Active Album</i>. This means, when
using this
button, the
selected picture will be added to the <i>Active Album</i>.
If no album is selected as active,
the <i>Add</i> button is disabled (gray). Further
on, it is also possible
to add all the pictures displayed on a page or to add all the pictures
displayed
on all the pages (of one picture list) to the selected album. <br />
All pictures already added to the&nbsp;<i>Active </i><i> Album</i>
will be displayed with
a blue
frame so that the user can easily see which pictures are already in the
album.
This means, when changing the&nbsp;<i>Active </i><i> Album</i>, the
blue frames
around the
pictures will change too, based on the&nbsp;<i>Active </i><i> Album</i>.<br />
It is not possible to add a picture more than once to an album.<br />
<a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><br />
<br /><h3><a name="6.4_View_content_of_an_Album"></a>6.4
View content of an Album</h3>
To view the contents of
an album (the pictures and the detailed metadata of the album), the
user has to
select the album in one of the album lists (<i>My Albums</i>
or <i>Published Albums</i>). The active album can also be viewed
via the link below the corresponding drop down menu.<br />
For each album, all the available metadata are displayed. When some
fields are
missing, it is because they do not contain any input and are therefore
left
out.<br />
The <i>Author</i> of the album is always the owner of the
album. All further
authors
are labeled as <i>Further Authors</i>.<br /> <a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><br />
<br /><h2><a name="7._Export_Pictures"></a>7.
Export
Pictures</h2>
<!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Export,Agreement)-->It
is only possible to
export albums (private and published ones) not pictures themselves. So,
in
order to export a picture, first an album has to be created which
contains the
relevant picture(s). This album can be exported then, which means that
all
pictures in this album will be exported.<br />
During the export, the user can choose which formats of the pictures
they want
to export (<i>Thumbnails or Web Resolution</i>),
and whether
they
want to have the attributes exported in a separate csv file or whether
to get
all attributes and technical metadata of the pictures in a separate xml
file.<br />
<br />Before exporting, the user has to submit to the FACES
release agreement
(a
short version of the one attached to the application form for a user
account).
Thus, the awareness that the user is dealing with sensitive data is
reassured.<br /> <a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><br />
<br /><h2><a name="8._Usage_Statistics"></a>8.
Usage
Statistics</h2>
<!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Statistic Visits) -->The
FACES solution stores
some anonymous usage statistics: the number of visits (number of
different
retrievals of the home page once per user session) for all users, the
number of
executed log-ins, the number of executed exports, and the number of
exported
pictures. These data will be evaluated per month and year.<br />
These usage statistics are only visible to the administrator(s) of
FACES.<br /> <a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><br /><br />
