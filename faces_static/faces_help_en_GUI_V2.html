FACES
is a database of facial expressions in
adults of different ages that is freely available for usage
in scientific research. It contains 2,052 pictures of naturalistic
facial
expressions of 171 younger, middle-aged, and older
adults. For each person, two sets of images&nbsp;depicting
six different emotions&nbsp;(neutrality,
sadness,
disgust, fear, anger, and happiness) are available.
<br />To protect the personal rights of the people involved, the
pictures contained in FACES are made available to researchers on a
case-by-case&nbsp;(i.e., person-by-person and study-by-study)
basis. Unregistered users
can view 72 example pictures of
six different individuals to gain insight into the FACES collection and
some of its software. Logged-in users will see all available pictures
and&nbsp;have the possibility to create their own (private or
published)&nbsp;<a href="#3._Album">albums</a>.
<br />Full access to this online service is possible only after
registration
and log-in. To apply for an account, please complete the <a href="https://zim02.gwdg.de/repos/faces/trunk/faces/faces_static/doc/agreement.pdf" target="_blank">application form</a>.<br /><a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#Faces_Help">top</a><br /><h3><a name="1.1_News"></a>1.1 News</h3>
FACES will be extended over time by the addition of further data and
functions. All information
concerning the development of the database will be posted in the News
section of the FACES homepage. This section is based on an external
blog,
which is also linked to FACES via the <i>Blog</i> link in
the meta menu at the top right of each page.<br /> <a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><br /><h3><a name="1.2_Login"></a><!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Login) -->1.2

Pictures</h2>
All
pictures contained in FACES are listed on the <i>Pictures</i>
page. <h3><a name="2.1_Picture_List"></a>2.1
Picture List</h3>In this list, you can browse through all
available pictures. It is possible to change the number of hits
displayed per page and the
sorting order. Changes in the display will be saved until the end
of the&nbsp;session. It is also possible to go directly to a
particular page of the list.<br /><br /><b>Sort</b><br />The
pictures displayed can be
ordered according to five attributes: <i>Age, Emotion, Gender,
Person-ID, </i>and<i>
Picture Set. </i><br />Per default, the following multiple
sorting will be used:
<i>Emotion</i> (sorted alphabetically: <i>Anger,
Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutrality, Sadness), Person-ID,
Picture Set.
</i><br />You can change the sorting by selecting the
appropriate&nbsp;criteria from the drop-down boxes, clicking the
adjacent arrow to specify whether ascending or
descending order is required and&nbsp;confirming this selection
by clicking on <i>Sort</i>.<br /><a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#Faces_Help">top</a><br /><br /><b><a name="Add_pictures_to_an_Album"></a>Add pictures to an
Album</b><br />It is possible to add pictures to a
private album (but not to published or withdrawn
albums) when viewing pictures in almost all display
formats&nbsp;(such
as
browse, search results, detailed view of a picture). First, the album
must be activated (<i>Make active</i>) in the album list
(see <a href="#3.1_Album_List">Album
List</a>). The active album will be displayed in the row above
the pictures (which is colored green when an album is activated, and is
otherwise white).<br />An <i>Add</i>
button is
displayed below each picture in FACES; clicking this button adds the
selected picture to the active album. This function is also available
for the detailed view of a picture that is already part of an album,
but not the selected one. It is&nbsp;also possible
to add all the pictures displayed on one page or all the
pictures
displayed
on all pages&nbsp;of a picture list to the active album. <br />If
no
active album is selected, the <i>Add</i> button is
disabled (black)<br />
All pictures added to the active album
will be marked with
a&nbsp;green frame so that you can easily see which pictures
are already included in the
album and which are not.&nbsp;<br />
It is not possible to add a picture to an album more than once.<br />

Picture
View </h3>
The
<i>View</i> button below each picture has the same effect
as
clicking on the
picture itself. It provides detailed information about the picture (its
attributes and values) and
an
enlarged version in optimal resolution for use on the internet
(labeled <i>Web
Resolution).</i>
<br />It is also possible to view the technical metadata of
the picture
in its
original resolution and the original resolution itself (by
clicking on the
picture).<br />When viewing the details of a picture,
it is possible to go directly to the
details for the previous/next picture in the selected picture list.<br />It
is also possible to <i>Toggle
between sets.</i> Two pictures of each emotion are available
for&nbsp;each person. The
difference
between these two sets of pictures is&nbsp;labeled using the
attribute <i>Picture
Set</i>
with values <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. Clicking
on <i>Toggle between sets</i> displays the
same picture from the other picture set for
detailed comparison. This function is only available in the detailed
view
during browsing, and not when
viewing a
picture in an album.<br />During browsing in the detailed view, it is also possible to display <i>All pictures of the selected person</i>. <br />Pictures from the detailed
view can also be added to a private album. For details see <a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#Add_pictures_to_an_Album">Add

Albums</h2>
An
album is a set
of selected pictures created by a user. The
aim is to give researchers the opportunity to create their own
selection
of pictures for use in further studies. Albums may be&nbsp;private
selections (visible only to the user who created them) or published for
purposes of&nbsp;referencing in a publication (visible to
all&nbsp;FACES users). <br />You
have to be logged in to the system to use the album functions. You are
then able to activate each album you have created and to add pictures
to it during browsing (see&nbsp;<a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#Add_pictures_to_an_Album">Add
pictures to an
album</a>).<br /><a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><h3><a name="3.1_Album_List"></a>3.1
Album
List</h3>
This list displays all albums accessible to the user: all albums
created by the individual
user (identified via the user account) irrespective of their status
(private,
published, or withdrawn) and all albums published by
FACES&nbsp;users. If the user is not logged in, this list contains
only all published albums.
<br />As for picture lists, you can
change the number of hits displayed per page and the sorting order.
Changes in
the display will be saved until the end
of the session. It is also possible to go directly to a particular page
of the list.<br /><br /><b>Organize</b><br />You
can create a new album by clicking on <i>Create Album</i>
and entering the
required information (album name, author name and affiliation).
Information on further authors and a description of the
album's content can be added optionally. You can immediately
select the new album as the <i>Active Album</i>. This
selection remains valid until you activate another of
your&nbsp;private
albums or closes the session.<br />A newly created album is
automatically given the status <b>private</b>. That means
that it is visible only to the person (identified via the user account)
who created it (i.e., the <i>Owner</i>), who can now add
and remove pictures as required (see&nbsp;<a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#Add_pictures_to_an_Album">Add
pictures to an
album</a>). The owner also has the option to edit the
album`s metadata (see&nbsp;<a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#Edit_album">Edit
album</a>) or to delete the whole album (see <a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#Delete_album">Delete album</a>).<br />It
is possible to delete several private albums from the list in one step.
To do this, you must select the checkbox in front of the album names
and click on <i>Delete selected albums</i>.<br /><br /><b>
Filter</b><br />The
album list can be filtered for following criteria: all
albums, all public albums, my
albums, my public albums, my
private albums, and my withdrawn albums.<br /><br /><b>Sort</b><br />The
album list can be sorted in ascending or descending order by the
following criteria: status, album name, and date last modified. <br /><a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#Faces_Help">top</a><br /><h3><a name="3.2_Album_View"></a><!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: View an album list) -->3.2
Album View</h3>To view the contents of an album (the pictures and
detailed metadata), you have to select the album by clicking on its
name in the album list. The active album can also be viewed via the row
above the list (which is colored green when an active album is
activated, and is otherwise white). All metadata available for each
album is displayed. If fields are missing, it is because they do not
contain any input.<br />The pictures in an album can be browsed
and viewed in the same way as the pictures in a&nbsp;<a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#2.1_Picture_List">picture
list</a>. They can also be removed from the album by selecting
the <i>Remove</i> button below each picture.<br /><br /><b>Sort</b><br />The
pictures in an album can be sorted in the same way as the pictures in a
<a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#2.1_Picture_List">picture
list</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br /><b>Organize<br /></b>The
functions available under <i>Organize</i> depend on the
current status of the
album.<br /><br />Private:<br /><ul><li><a name="Edit_album"></a><b>Edit
album:</b>&nbsp;Allows the owner of the album to edit the
album's metadata.</li><li><a name="Delete_album"></a><b>Delete
album:</b>&nbsp;Allows albums that are no longer needed to be
deleted by the owner. Once deleted, an album cannot be restored.</li>
<li><a name="Publish_album"></a><!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Confirm Publish) --><b>Publish
album:&nbsp;</b>Allows the owner of an album to make its
content visible to all FACES
users. A published album can not longer be edited, changed, or deleted,
because it may already have been cited by another FACES user. A user
who is not logged in and who follows a link to a published album will
see only the metadata of that album and the publicly available
pictures. The other pictures are visible only to logged-in users. </li><li><b>Remove
all
pictures on
this page / in this album</b>:&nbsp;Allows the user to remove
all pictures displayed on the current page or all pictures in the album.</li></ul>Published:<br /><ul><li><a name="Withdraw_album"></a><!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Confirm Withdrawn) --><b>Withdraw
album</b>:&nbsp;The only way to delete a published album is
to withdraw it. You are
requested to enter a comment specifying the reason for withdrawal. The
album now has the status <b>withdrawn</b>. It is no longer
visible in the FACES
overview of published albums, but is still retrievable for users who
know the exact URL of the album, which will remain valid. (The album
may already have been cited. Persistent URLs ensure that links to
albums will remain valid over time. However, the withdrawal comment
indicates why the creator of the album has changed its status.) The
withdrawn album remains visible in the owner's album list.</li></ul><a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><h3><a name="3.3_Export"></a>3.3 Export</h3>It is
possible to export (private and published) albums, but not individual
pictures. In order to export a picture, you must first create an album
containing the relevant picture(s). This album can then be exported.
You can select the required picture format (<i>Thumbnails</i>
or <i>Web Resolution</i>) and specify whether the
attributes should be exported in a separate csv file or the attributes
together with the technical metadata should be exported in a separate
xml file.<br />Before
exporting, you have to agree to the FACES release agreement (a short
version of the agreement signed when applying for a user account), thus
confirming your awareness that you are dealing with sensitive data.<br />It is not currently possible to export albums with more than 800 pictures. However, the <i>Download Collection</i> button under <i>Pictures</i> allows you to download the whole FACES collection in one step.<br /><a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><br /><br />
<h2><a name="4._Search"></a>4.&nbsp;Search</h2><h3><a name="4.1_Advanced_Search"></a><!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Advance Search, Search Results)-->4.1
Advanced Search</h3>This search function applies to pictures
only. It is possible to search within the whole FACES collection
(default setting) or within a specific published&nbsp;<a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#3._Album">album</a>. <br />All
searches are carried out on the basis of the attributes used to
describe each picture&nbsp;(e.g., <i>Emotion</i>, <i>Age</i>).
Please note that when several search components are selected, the
following rule applies: search criteria within the same attribute will
be combined using the Boolean operator "OR"&nbsp;(e.g., <i>Emotion</i>
= <i>Anger</i> OR <i>Emotion</i> = <i>Happiness</i>),
whereas search criteria specified for different types of attributes
will be connected by the Boolean operator "AND"&nbsp;(e.g., <i>Age</i>
= <i>Young</i> AND <i>Emotion</i>
= <i>Happiness</i>).<br />It is possible to add a
picture from the search results to a private album. For details, see <a href="faces_help_en_GUI_V2.html#Add_pictures_to_an_Album">Add
pictures to an album</a>. <br /><br /><b>Person-ID
</b><br />It is possible to search for a specific person
via their ID. Please note that all IDs are in the range 004-182, but
that not all numbers within this range are assigned to a person (there
are only 171 people in the collection).<br />&nbsp;<br /><b>Picture
Set
</b><br />Two sets of images depicting the six different
emotions are available for each person. These two <i>Picture Sets</i>
are
labeled <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. Pictures were
randomly assigned to set <i>a</i>
or <i>b</i>. The labels are not intended as a quality
criterion but rather for comparison purposes.<br /><a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><h3><a name="4.2_Public_Album_Search"></a><!-- (Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Public Albums Search)-->4.2
Public Album
Search</h3>This search function applies to albums. Here, it is
only possible for users to enter a free-text search string that will be
used to search in the album names, authors, affiliations, and
descriptions of all published albums (private and withdrawn albums are
not searchable). <br /><a href="#Faces_Help">top</a><br /><br /><h2><a name="5._Usage_Statistics"></a><!--(Following pages from the GUI prototype should linked here: Statistic Visits) -->5.
