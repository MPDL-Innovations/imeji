about_03 = The database comprises two sets of pictures per person and per facial expression, resulting in a total of 2,052 images. It was developed between 2005 and 2007 by Ulman Lindenberger, Natalie Ebner, and Michaela Riediger at the Center for Lifespan Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany.
